# Lesson

### Class:
`.(Class name)`

### id:
`#(id name)`

When referring to a parent class or id, it is important that order matters. If the class you want to refer to is inside another class, first refer to the outside class, and the refer to the inner class.

Example:
`.menu, .row`
or: `.menu, #row`

You can also refer to HTML such as `a`, `span`, `div`, etc. However, be careful not to change everything with the HTML thing you used.

Next: we can use javascript and Sass to make flashcards for possible code in Sass. We can give a definition and the blank out the command, the person guesses it and checks if they got it correct.
