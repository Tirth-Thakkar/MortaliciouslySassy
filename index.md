Notes for expectations:
three UI's that are good:
- Github Pages or Sassy
- Bootstrap on a flask
- Tailwind
    - Focus on one UI
- If using Bootstrp or Tailwind, use flask

Assign HW: give 30 min of homework to play around with the code

- Do frontend on a game-centric plan or something like that and make changes on it using Sass
    - We can fix the snake game

Examples:
- We can make multiple examples(calculator, snake, etc.)
    - Then, we make same classes for all these different examples and use Sass so that the styling changes things of multiple examples.
